Computer programming is the art, craft and science of writing programs which define how computers operate. This book will teach you how to write computer programs using a programming language designed by Google named Go.

计算机编程是一门艺术、 工艺和科学，编写计算机程序来定义计算机是如何运作的。这本书将教你如何用GOOGLE设计的GO语言来书写编写程序。

Go is a general purpose programming language with advanced features and a clean syntax. Because of its wide availability on a variety of platforms, its robust well-documented common library, and its focus on good software engineering principles, Go is an ideal language to learn as your first programming language.

Go 是通用编程语言提供了高级功能和清洁的语法。在各种平台上，都提供了强健的翔实通用库，它注重良好的软件工程原则和广泛的可用性，所以 Go作为学习编程语言的第一选择是非常理想的。

The process we use to write software using Go (and most programming languages) is fairly straightforward: 


* Gather requirements
* Find a solution
* Write source code to implement the solution
* Compile the source code into an executable
* Run and test the program to make sure it works

我们使用Go编写软件（像大多数编程语言一样）编写的过程是相当简单的：

* 收集需求
* 找到解决的办法
* 编写源代码实现解决方案
* 将源代码编译成可执行文件
* 运行并测试该程序以确保它正常工作

This process is iterative (meaning its done many times) and the steps usually overlap. But before we write our first program in Go there are a few prerequisite concepts we need to understand.

这是一个迭代工程（指其做很多次）的步骤，通常还会互相重叠。但我们编写我们的第一个程序之前有必要了解几个概念。

##Files and Folders
##文件和文件夹

A file is a collection of data stored as a unit with a name. Modern operating systems (like Windows or Mac OSX) contain millions of files which store a large variety of different types of information – everything from text documents to executable programs to multimedia files.

一个文件是作为一个单元名称与存储的数据的集合。现代操作系统 （如 Windows 或 Mac OSX） 包含数以百万计的存储大量各种不同类型的信息 — — 一切从文本文档到多媒体文件的可执行程序的文件。
