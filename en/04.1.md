## How to Name a Variable

Naming a variable properly is an important part of software development. Names must start with a letter and may contain letters, numbers or the `_` (underscore) symbol. The Go compiler doesn't care what you name a variable so the name is meant for your (and others) benefit. Pick names which clearly describe the variable's purpose. Suppose we had the following:

    x := "Max"
    fmt.Println("My dog's name is", x)

In this case x is not a very good name for a variable. A better name would be:

    name := "Max"
    fmt.Println("My dog's name is", name)

or even:

    dogsName := "Max"
    fmt.Println("My dog's name is", dogsName)

In this last case we use a special way to represent multiple words in a variable name known as lower camel case (also know as mixed case, bumpy caps, camel back or hump back). The first letter of the first word is lowercase, the first letter of the subsequent words is uppercase and all the other letters are lowercase.
