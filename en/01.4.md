##Go Tools

Go is a compiled programming language, which means source code (the code you write) is translated into a language that your computer can understand. Therefore before we can write a Go program, we need the Go compiler.

The installer will setup Go for you automatically. We will be using version 1 of the language. (More information can be found at [http://www.golang.org](http://www.golang.org))

Let's make sure everything is working. Open up a terminal and type the following:

    go version

You should see the following:

    go version go1.0.2

Your version number may be slightly different. If you get an error about the command not being recognized try restarting your computer.

The Go tool suite is made up of several different commands and sub-commands. A list of those commands is available by typing:

    go help

We will see how they are used in subsequent chapters.
