## An Example Program

Here's an example program which takes in a number entered by the user and doubles it:

    package main

    import "fmt"

    func main() {
        fmt.Print("Enter a number: ")
        var input float64
        fmt.Scanf("%f", &input)
    
        output := input * 2
    
        fmt.Println(output)    
    }

We use another function from the `fmt` package to read the user input (`Scanf`). `&input` will be explained in a later chapter, for now all we need to know is that `Scanf` fills input with the number we enter.
Problems

 * What are two ways to create a new variable?
 * What is the value of `x` after running:

    x := 5; x += 1?

 * What is scope and how do you determine the scope of a variable in Go?
 * What is the difference between `var` and `const`?
 * Using the example program as a starting point, write a program that converts from Fahrenheit into Celsius. (`C = (F - 32) * 5/9`)
 * Write another program that converts from feet into meters. (`1 ft = 0.3048 m`)
