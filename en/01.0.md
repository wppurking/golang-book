#Getting Started
Computer programming is the art, craft and science of writing programs which define how computers operate. This book will teach you how to write computer programs using a programming language designed by Google named Go.

Go is a general purpose programming language with advanced features and a clean syntax. Because of its wide availability on a variety of platforms, its robust well-documented common library, and its focus on good software engineering principles, Go is an ideal language to learn as your first programming language.

The process we use to write software using Go (and most programming languages) is fairly straightforward: 

* Gather requirements
* Find a solution
* Write source code to implement the solution
* Compile the source code into an executable
* Run and test the program to make sure it works

This process is iterative (meaning its done many times) and the steps usually overlap. But before we write our first program in Go there are a few prerequisite concepts we need to understand.
