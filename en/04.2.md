## Scope

Going back to the program we saw at the beginning of the chapter:

	package main

	import "fmt"

	func main() {
    	var x string = "Hello World"
    	fmt.Println(x)
	}

Another way of writing this program would be like this:

	package main

	import "fmt"

	var x string = "Hello World"

	func main() {
   	 fmt.Println(x)
	}

Notice that we moved the variable outside of the main function. This means that other functions can access this variable:

	var x string = "Hello World"

	func main() {
    	fmt.Println(x)
	}

	func f() {
    	fmt.Println(x)
	}

The f function now has access to the `x` variable. Now suppose that we wrote this instead:

	func main() {
    	var x string = "Hello World"
    	fmt.Println(x)
	}

	func f() {
    	fmt.Println(x)
	}

If you run this program you should see an error:

	.\main.go:11: undefined: x

The compiler is telling you that the `x` variable inside of the `f` function doesn't exist. It only exists inside of the `main` function. The range of places where you are allowed to use `x` is called the scope of the variable. According to the language specification “Go is lexically scoped using blocks”. Basically this means that the variable exists within the nearest curly braces `{` `}` (a block) including any nested curly braces (blocks), but not outside of them. Scope can be a little confusing at first; as we see more Go examples it should become more clear.
