## Variables

Up until now we have only seen programs that use literal values (numbers, strings, etc.) but such programs aren't particularly useful. To make truly useful programs we need to learn two new concepts: variables and control flow statements. This chapter will explore variables in more detail.

A variable is a storage location, with a specific type and an associated name. Let's change the program we wrote in chapter 2 so that it uses a variable:

    package main

    import "fmt"

    func main() {
        var x string = "Hello World"
        fmt.Println(x)
    }

Notice that the string literal from the original program still appears in this program, but rather than send it directly to the `Println` function we assign it to a variable instead. Variables in Go are created by first using the `var` keyword, then specifying the variable name (`x`), the type (`string`) and finally assigning a value to the variable (`Hello World`). The last step is optional so an alternative way of writing the program would be like this:

    package main

    import "fmt"

    func main() {
        var x string
        x = "Hello World"
        fmt.Println(x)
    }

Variables in Go are similar to variables in algebra but there are some subtle differences:

First when we see the `=`symbol we have a tendency to read that as “x equals the string Hello World”. There's nothing wrong with reading our program that way, but it's better to read it as “x takes the string Hello World” or “x is assigned the string Hello World”. This distinction is important because (as their name would suggest) variables can change their value throughout the lifetime of a program. Try running the following:

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var x string
    x = "first"
    fmt.Println(x)
    x = "second"
    fmt.Println(x)
}

In fact you can even do this:

    var x string
    x = "first "
    fmt.Println(x)
    x = x + "second"
    fmt.Println(x)

This program would be nonsense if you read it like an algebraic theorem. But it makes sense if you are careful to read the program as a list of commands. When we see `x = x + "second"` we should read it as “assign the concatenation of the value of the variable x and the string literal second to the variable x.” The right side of the `=` is done first and the result is then assigned to the left side of the `=`.

The `x = x + y` form is so common in programming that Go has a special assignment statement: `+=`. We could have written `x = x + "second"` as `x += "second"` and it would have done the same thing. (Other operators can be used the same way)

Another difference between Go and algebra is that we use a different symbol for equality: `==`. (Two equal signs next to each other) `==` is an operator like `+` and it returns a boolean. For example:

    var x string = "hello"
    var y string = "world"
    fmt.Println(x == y)

This program should print `false` because `hello` is not the same as `world`. On the other hand:

    var x string = "hello"
    var y string = "hello"
    fmt.Println(x == y)

This will print `true` because the two strings are the same.

Since creating a new variable with a starting value is so common Go also supports a shorter statement:

    x := "Hello World"

Notice the `:` before the `=` and that no type was specified. The type is not necessary because the Go compiler is able to infer the type based on the literal value you assign the variable. (Since you are assigning a string literal, `x` is given the type `string`) The compiler can also do inference with the `var` statement:

    var x = "Hello World"

The same thing works for other types:

    x := 5
    fmt.Println(x)

Generally you should use this shorter form whenever possible.
